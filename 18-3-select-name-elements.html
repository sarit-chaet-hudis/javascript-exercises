<!-- I agree it is generally preferable to use an Array for this.

However, this can also be accomplished in JavaScript by simply adding properties to the current scope (the global scope, if top-level code; the function scope, if within a function) by simply using this â€“ which always refers to the current scope.

for (var i = 0; i < coords.length; ++i) {
    this["marker"+i] = "some stuff";
}
You can later retrieve the stored values (if you are within the same scope as when they were set):

var foo = this.marker0;
console.log(foo); // "some stuff"
This slightly odd feature of JavaScript is rarely used (with good reason), but in certain situations it can be useful. -->
